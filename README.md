International Fiscal Transparency Index
==============

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

We are developing the International Fiscal Transparency Index (IFT). This index aims to measure how willing a country is to release minimally credible information about its central government's fiscal position through international institutions and by extension to international investors.

The Index examines whether or not countries report at all the following items to the International Monetary Fund's Government Finance Statistics database in a given year:
