International Fiscal Transparency Index
==============

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

We are developing the International Fiscal Transparency Index (IFT). This index aims to measure how willing a country is to release minimally credible information about its central government's fiscal position through international institutions and by extension to international investors.

The index will use a Hierarchical Bayesian Item Response Theory model developed in [Gandrud, Copelovitch, and Hallerberg (2015)](https://github.com/FGCH/FRTIndex) to estimate latent fiscal transparency. The Index examines whether or not countries report at all the following items to the International Monetary Fund's Government Finance Statistics database in a given year:

- General government gross debt (% of GDP)

- General government net debt (% of GDP)

- General government net lending/borrowing (% of GDP)

- General government primary net lending/borrowing (% of GDP)

- General government revenue (% of GDP)

- General government total expenditure (% of GDP)

These items are chosen because they are also included in the IMF's World Economic Outlook.
